### Quick bio
I was born and raised in France from two Vietnamese parents. My childhood happened mainly (20 years) in Toulouse (south of France) where I did about all my education, including preparatory classes to the Grandes Ecoles as well as my Grande Ecole (the [N7 Institute of Technology](https://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html)).

I got my two first jobs in Toulouse area and although the human and managerial sides of the spectrum were absolutely amazing, I felt a little bit lonely in my quest for excellency in terms of software.

A friend of mine introduced me to an opportunity in Paris area for a company that had high technical standards, and that's how I ended up in Paris area in 2019.

Because of the not-so-funny background of my parents and the culture clash, I was raised in a culture a little bit shifted from the one in France:
* my mom was in charge of everything and hyper-prioritized studying to protect me from misery
* my dad was in charge of bringing the money home and... And that's that.

The expectations I developed towards parental figures from living in France clashed with these points quite early, and very soon school would become my reward circuit : being a good student for my teachers would then be my main source of acknowledgement.

For this reason, I am consistently (read: as my main passion even in my personal life) thinking about improving my craft in software engineering, more as an identity and self-worth matter, and more as a creative space where I can express myself, rather than just a trade between my time/energy, and money.


### Random facts
* My Myers Briggs personality type is on of the rarest: [INFP](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality) aka the Mediator aka the Idealist aka the Healer
	* I would _really_ encourage you to read the link above. It's valuable.
* I could be described as a person who is _too_ constructive. When I want to tackle a problem, I lay all my cards on the table and ask things in a very frontal fashion.
* I am very persistent and have great endurance. I have absolutely no issue with talking until everything is clear, even if it takes 3 hours. I don't get tired. This can cause an accumulation effect that might bother you(read: make you think I have a will to dominate others).

### What are my favourite things to work on
* Optimizing the time required to get an information about the project. This includes stuff like:
	* Clean Code
	* Clean (ie UseCase-Driven) Architecture
	* Scripts-as-documentation
	* Tests-as-documentation
	* Git-log-as-documentation
	* Domain-Driven Design
	* Making sure newcomers have a guided tour of the organization/application when they arrive
* Optimizing my development workflow. It means scripts, of course, but also things like making my own IDE.
* Retrospectives & Continuous improvement. I am literally an idea machine. This _also_ can cause an accumulation effect that might bother you (read: make you think I have a will to dominate others)

### What I value from others
* Straight-forwardedness
* Open-mindedness
* Transparency
* Curiosity
* The will to improve

### What I think my strengthes are
* Passion
* Perseverance
* The value of a lifestyle dedicated to improve my software craftmanship
* An unusual take on things - stemming from having interests that are quite far from the mainstream - for example, I took onto myself to master vim.

### Things I'm trying to improve in myself
* My craft
* How to make my straightforwardedness not hurtful nor misinterpreted
* Having a personal life less centered around improving my craft

### What makes me uncomfortable
* People who I feel know have the skills to lead the conversation the way they'd want
* Using buzzwords in their incorrect meaning because "it is what works"
* Money as a life goal
* Being seen as a leader. I want to be part of a community that advances as one. I like to be the crazy scientist, not the squad captain.

### What makes me grumpy
* Environments where I cannot retreat into a silent/undisturbed mood
* Hate trains/Discrimination/Narrowmindedness/Oversimplification/Lack-of-will-to-empathize/understand-the-others
* Having someone prevent me from participating efficiently to continuous improvement
* Displaying a fake/improved/self-entitled version of myself, for example to sell myself

### How to know when I'm (really) grumpy
* Because I'm a straight-forward and transparent person, it'll show/I'll mention it very quickly by myself

### What past managers have done that I like
* Consistently use rewording techniques to make sure everything is well heard and understood
* Spend time with each person in the team, talking about what motivates them, work or not work, during/outside of work hours
* Be on such good terms with the whole team that everyone proactively wants to spend time with said manager
* Create an environment where the whole team often gathers to have positive/constructive interactions
* Ask "How can I help you?" instead of "Do this that way"

### What I do outside of work
* I think. About software craftmanship.
* I experiment. Ideas I get while thinking about software craftmanship.
* I play video games or take walks.

### Things I'd love to do in the future
* Bring more diversity in my hobbies. Other crafts come to mind: cooking, cocktail-making, dancing, etc.
* Exercise

### How to communicate with me
* Say it. Just the way it came up in your head. Go for it straight up.

### Preferred communication method
* Chat, definitely.

### Working Hours
* Because I work during my work hours, and think/work during my free time, sometimes I might go to bed late.
* But I try to be present before 10 and until 18
* It's not rare to see me still connectec up until 23.

### What my average week looks like
* Get up, do what I'm paid for, improve my craft, try to take a walk, go to bed.
* I'd have a gaming session with friends on Tuesday night
* I'd try to organize restaurant/bar with friends any evening in the week
* Gaming on Saturday
* Work on my ideas on Sunday as well as cleaning my place
