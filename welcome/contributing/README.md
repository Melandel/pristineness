Containing more than guidelines, this folder persists the project's technical culture and in particular, positions regarding technical matters.

Usually, people come and go ; and thus, preferences and understanding in terms of architecture also fluctuate.

Most of the time, [cargo cult programming](../glossary/cargo_cult_programming/README.md) makes itself a good spot, and [broken window](../glossary/broken_window/README.md) after broken window, [software entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy) makes its way into the codebase more and more easily.

This is a cultural transition issue.

In order to retain the strengthes of the original architecture, the original intentions and preferences are listed in this folder.
